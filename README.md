# VideoUtilsIOS
Some little functions that can be useful if you work with video on IOS. The language used is SWIFT

During my past project i had the chance to work with videos in IOS, and some times i found it hard to manipulate videos expecially if you don't have a deep knowledge of the core IOS.
So i decided to publish this repository with some of the functions i used most on videos.

All the functions are working on IOS version 11, maybe there could be some little problem with the iPhone X, i haven't got one to test.

The functions are:
  - Save video to your gallery.
  - Compress video to some resolution and convert it to .mp4
  - Get a thumbnail image from the video
  - Add any image as watermark to the video
  - Put the video in the center of a square with custom size and background
  
  
Feel free to use or edit the functions as you want.

Hope this can help someone, Bye :smile:
